# graph2image

shitty *api* for working with images in java

## With g2i you can:
 - draw any real function
 - draw lines
 - draw rects(filled and not filled)
 - draw points!!!
 - draw graphs(by points)
 - draw strings(our font renderer supports russian letters too)

## TODO:
 - rotation system
 - negative numbers
 - finish line3
 - rewrote structure of code
 - cool readme
